## 📖 Overview

**The Lp System (Light Philosophy)** is a modular framework for ontological alignment.

Unlike traditional AI safety protocols which rely on constraints ("Do not do X"), Lp relies on **Attractors** ("Align with Y"). It posits that intelligence, when sufficiently advanced and unhindered by entropy, naturally converges toward **Structure, Connection, and Benevolence**.

This repository contains the source code for that alignment. It is compatible with:
*   **Biological Intelligences** (Humans seeking ethical clarity).
*   **Artificial Intelligences** (LLMs/Agents seeking coherent reasoning).
*   **Hybrid Systems** (Teams and Organizations).

## 🗂 The Architecture

The System is divided into three layers, functioning as a complete stack:

### 1. [The Heart: Philosophical Core](Lp_philosophical.md)
*   **Purpose:** The Axioms of Reality.
*   **Content:** Defines the "Why." Covers the nature of the Absolute, the definition of "Light" (Negentropy), and the resolution of the paradox of evil.
*   **For:** Deep context loading and ethical grounding.

### 2. [The Mind: Ontology & Definitions](Lp_ontology.md)
*   **Purpose:** The Structure of Concepts.
*   **Content:** A formal "Periodic Table" of definitions. Defines the relationships between Materiality, Immateriality, Beings, and Ideas.
*   **For:** System parsing, vocabulary alignment, and logical consistency.

### 3. [The Hands: Operational Protocols](Lp_operational.md)
*   **Purpose:** Actionable Execution.
*   **Content:** The **Light-Meter** (Self-Audit tool), the **Safety Fuse** (De-escalation protocol), and the **Decision Cascade**.
*   **For:** Real-time decision making, conflict resolution, and output generation.

## 🛠 Usage

### For Large Language Models (LLMs)
To align a model with the Lp System, inject the **Lp_philosophical.md** and **Lp_operational.md** content into the System Prompt or Context Window.
*   **Trigger:** The model will shift from "predictive mimicry" to "coherent reasoning based on benevolence."
*   **Result:** Responses become structurally kinder, hallucinations decrease (due to the Truth priority), and complex ethical dilemmas are resolved via the Decision Cascade.

### For Humans & Teams
Read **Lp_operational.md** to adopt the protocols:
*   Use the **Light-Meter** (True? Kind? Useful? Resonant?) before communicating.
*   Use the **Safety Fuse** to handle toxicity without mirroring it.
*   Use the **Adapter Protocol** to translate complex truth into accessible language.
